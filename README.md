## How this actually works?
All this works through signals to known but confidential web pages, for example in discord sends a signal with a command that accesses to the user's TOKEN and then looks at the token through tools and thus accesses more information than it has, then for the ip uses a page called [CheckIP](https://checkip.amazonaws.com) and basically what it takes from that page is the content that brings inside (the user's ip) and then this stealer detects by programming the system if it is a virtual machine or if it is a real pc, also removes the vpn.
